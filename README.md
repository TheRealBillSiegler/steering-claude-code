# steering-claude-code

A decision guide for where a Claude Code behavior should live — CLAUDE.md, a rules file, a skill, a subagent, a hook, an output style, or a system-prompt append. Built from an Anthropic engineering article plus the enforcement mechanics the article doesn't cover, anchored to the official docs.

One skill, no hooks — nothing always-on beyond its listing description.

| Component | What it does | Fires when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skills/steering-claude-code/` | Decision tree across the steering mechanisms, with per-option enforcement mechanics and a worked hook example. | You ask where a behavior should live, or why an instruction keeps being ignored |

## Install

**Via the central marketplace**, alongside Bill Siegler's other plugins:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/TheRealBillSiegler/siegler-plugins
/plugin install steering-claude-code@siegler-plugins
```

**Direct from this repo**, standalone:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/TheRealBillSiegler/steering-claude-code
/plugin install steering-claude-code@steering-claude-code
```

The doubled name is correct — this repo self-registers as a one-plugin marketplace, so the marketplace name and the plugin name are both `steering-claude-code`.

Then restart or run `/reload-plugins` — no install form takes effect in a running session.

## Verify

Invoke it: ask "where should a never-push-to-main rule live?" in a session with the plugin enabled — the answer should route to a hook or permission rule, not CLAUDE.md prose. The skill's application eval and its recorded baseline live in the plugin repo: [evals/scenarios.md](https://github.com/TheRealBillSiegler/steering-claude-code/blob/main/evals/scenarios.md).

## Relation to delegation-tiering

Split from the former `delegation-steering` plugin: this guide answers *where behavior lives*; its sibling [`delegation-tiering`](https://github.com/TheRealBillSiegler/delegation-tiering) answers *which model a delegated agent gets* and enforces it with hooks. The skill cites that plugin's gate as its worked enforcement example; neither requires the other.

## Source fidelity

Claims carry the same three provenance tiers as the sibling plugin — article digest, doc page, or dated live test — defined in [delegation-tiering's Anchoring policy](https://github.com/TheRealBillSiegler/delegation-tiering/blob/main/docs/REMEDIATION.md#anchoring-policy). The skill's Source section links the official doc pages behind the mechanics; the dated article digest and everything else used to build and verify the skill live in this repo's [docs/research/](docs/research/), not in the installed payload.
